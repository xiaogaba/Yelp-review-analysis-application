# Yelp-review-analysis-application

    In 2013, Yelp.com has announced the “Yelp Dataset Challenge” and invited students to use this data in an innovative way and break  
ground in research. In this project user would query this dataset to extract useful information for local businesses and individual users.
    The Yelp data is available in JSON format. This project will use a simplified dataset includes only 20,544 businesses, the reviews that 
are written for those businesses only, and the users that wrote those reviews. Populate database with the dataset. Generate INSERT 
statements for the tables and run those to insert data into Oracle DB.In this application, the user can filter the search results using 
available business attributes (i.e. facets) such as main category(ies), sub-category(ies), business attributes, days of the week, and hours
of a day. Each time the user clicks on a facet value; the set of results is reduced to only the items that have that value. Additional  
clicks continue to narrow down the search—the previous facet values are remembered and applied again. This application is a standalone 
Java application.
    Design and realize the application GUI which should provide the basic functionality for easy browsing of the business main-categories, 
sub-attributes and attributes.
